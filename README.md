# VuePortfolio101
Here I will be working on my own material to rebuild my portfolio website. Originally I used HTML, CSS, Javascript and React. 
Vue is used in the front developement, while Nodejs will be used in the back to help understand the flow of the files.
I will try to understand boot-strap through some of this too. Hopefully the git functions weill come as I work.
Wish me luck!
